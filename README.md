Syllabus Prep is way for students of the Oregon Music Teachers Association (OMTA) to study and prepare for their syllabus tests. Syllabus Prep will cover music theory for each syllabus level including ear training, rhythm training, and sight reading. This project is being developed in XCode in the Swift 3 language, and will eventually be released to the Apple Store.

The current state of this project is a work in progress. The list of stable builds are as follows:
