// Major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads. These are structured as
//  a tuple of a String and an Int8 array. The String describes what the
//  Chord type is, and is for answer verification when a user is given a
//  test question. The array contains 2 Int8 values: the value of the 
//  interval between root and third, and the value of the interval between
//  root and fifth.
