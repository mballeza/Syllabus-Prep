// Major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads. These are structured as
//  a tuple of a String and an Int8 array. The String describes what the
//  Chord type is, and is for answer verification when a user is given a
//  test question. The array contains 2 Int8 values: the value of the 
//  interval between root and third, and the value of the interval between
//  root and fifth.
//
// Please do not modify, add, or remove variables unless the following reasons occur:
//  -Half-step values are incorrect.
//  -OMTA requirements change.
//  -The entire Western Music Theory world suddenly encounters a time vortex
//   and the names and half-step values are changed.
